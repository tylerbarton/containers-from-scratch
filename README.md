# Containers From Scratch
A container is a lightweight environment which shares a kernal and resources from a host machine but isolates itself from other processes.

The resources that are shared by the host can be controlled by set flags by the caller.

# Types of Containers
- Process ID (pid)
- Network (net)
- User ID (user)
- UNIX Time-Sharing (uts)
- Interprocess Communication (ipc)
- Mount & Namespace (ns)
